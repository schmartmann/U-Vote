This app was intended to help `gameify` student voter registration before the [2016 election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocalypse_Now) by creating rivalries among universities to get the highest student voter registration rate. 

I built this app using Sinatra, and supported it with an ActiveRecord psql database. 

You can see it [here](http://www.u-vote.org).
